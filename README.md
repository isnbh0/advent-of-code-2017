# Advent of Code 2017

#### Source website for problems
[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

---

#### Dependencies
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) was the only notable non-builtin package used.

---

#### Caveats
* A few solutions originally involved manual calculation and thus include hardcoded components. For these, more generalizable solutions will be provided in the future.
* Some solutions (day24 especially) are quite inefficient time-wise. I hope to improve these in future updates.
